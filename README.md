# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is a collection of technologies that enables computers to perform advanced functions such as visual perception, language processing, data analysis, recommendations, and more. AI drives modern innovation by unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** uses AI to extract data from images and documents, transforming unstructured content into structured data, offering valuable insights.

## Introduction to Generative AI

**Artificial intelligence** is a field of science focused on creating machines that can reason, learn, and act as humans would or analyze data at scales beyond human capability. This broad discipline combines computer science, data analytics, engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.

For businesses, AI often utilizes **machine learning** and **deep learning** for data analytics, predictions, object categorization, natural language processing, and intelligent data retrieval.

### How Does AI Work?

AI relies heavily on **data**. By learning from large datasets, AI systems identify patterns and relationships that might elude human perception. The learning process typically involves algorithms, which are sets of rules that guide AI analysis and decision-making.

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms trained on data to predict or categorize information.
- **Deep Learning:** Uses neural networks with multiple layers to process information, mimicking the human brain's structure, and allowing AI to excel at tasks like image recognition and language translation.

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

AI can be categorized based on its development stages or functional capabilities:

1. **Reactive Machines:** Limited AI that responds to stimuli without learning from past data (e.g., IBM’s Deep Blue).
2. **Limited Memory:** Most modern AI systems; they learn and improve through new data (e.g., deep learning).
3. **Theory of Mind:** Hypothetical AI that could understand and react to human emotions.
4. **Self-Aware AI:** A theoretical AI with human-like consciousness, which does not yet exist.

Another categorization is **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**, AI specialized in a single task (e.g., Google Search). Future possibilities include **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** and **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**, where AI could match or exceed human capabilities, though these do not currently exist.

## Artificial Intelligence Training Models

AI training often relies on **training data**:

1. **Supervised Learning:** Maps specific inputs to outputs using labeled data (e.g., recognizing images of cats).
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data, useful for descriptive modeling.
3. **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Combines labeled and unlabeled data for improved results.
4. **Reinforcement Learning:** An agent learns by trial and error, receiving feedback to improve performance.

## Common Types of Artificial Neural Networks

Neural networks, loosely modeled on the human brain, are a primary AI architecture. Here are some commonly used types:

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FF):** Data flows one-way through layers; often paired with **backpropagation** for error correction.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Uses memory to process time-sequence data, ideal for language processing.
- **Long/Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** An advanced RNN type with memory cells for long-term dependencies, useful in speech recognition.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Common in image recognition, processes images through convolution and pooling layers to capture details.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):** Two competing networks (generator and discriminator) that improve output accuracy, used for creating realistic images and art.
